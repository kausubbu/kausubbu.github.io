      <h4><strong><strong>General Information</strong></strong></h4>
      <p align="justify">Machine Learning (ML) is that area of
        Artificial Intelligence that is concerned with computational
        artifacts that modify and improve their performance through
        experience. The area is concerned with issues both theoretical
        and practical. We will cover a variety of topics, including:
        statistical supervised and unsupervised learning methods,
        randomized search algorithms, Bayesian learning methods, and
        reinforcement learning. The course also covers theoretical
        concepts such as inductive bias, the PAC and Mistake-bound
        learning frameworks, minimum description length principle, and
        Ockham's Razor. In order to ground these methods the course
        includes some programming and involvement in a number of
        projects.</p>
      <h4><strong><strong>Objectives</strong></strong></h4>
      <p>The primary objectives of the course:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>To provide a broad survey of approaches and techniques in
            ML</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>To develop the skills that will help you to build
            intelligent, adaptive artifacts</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>To develop the basic skills necessary to pursue research in
            ML</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p align="justify">Almost all ML applications today require you to
        think like a researcher. The last objective will be at the core
        of this course.</p>
      <h4><strong><strong>Prerequisites</strong></strong></h4>
      <p align="justify">The official prerequisite for this course is an
        introductory course in artificial intelligence. CS 3600 or Peter
        Norvig and Sebastian Thrun's AI class on <a
          href="https://www.udacity.com/course/cs271">Udacity</a> should
        suffice. Apart from this, the most important prerequisite for
        enjoying and doing well in this class is your interest in the
        material. If you are not sure whether this class is for you,
        please talk to me.</p>
      <h4><strong><strong>Resources</strong></strong></h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><b>Readings.</b> The textbooks for the course: 1) <a
href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/user/mitchell/ftp/mlbook.html">Machine
              Learning</a> by Tom Mitchell and 2) <a
              href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-machine-learning">Introduction
              to Machine Learning</a> by Ethem Alpaydim. We will also
            use supplemental readings as well, but those will be
            provided for you.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><b>Computing.</b>&nbsp; Weblinks to ML toolboxes and
            datasets will provided for you (in the Resources tab). Also
            you are free to use whatever machines you want to do your
            work; however, the final result will have to run on the
            standard CoC boxes.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><b>Web.</b> We will use the Tsquare page to post course
            announcements, so check it early and often. We will also use
            Piazza to discuss course material offline. Course schedule
            is available in the Resources tab.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4><strong><strong>Grading</strong></strong></h4>
      <p align="justify">Your final grade is divided into four
        components: assignments, a group project, a midterm exam and a
        final exam.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p align="justify"><b>Assignments.</b> There will be two
            graded assignments. They will be about programming and
            analysis. Generally, they are designed to give you deeper
            insight into the material and to prepare you for the exams.
            The programming will be in service of allowing you to run
            and discuss experiments, do analysis, and so on.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p align="justify"><b>Group Project.</b> There is a
            semester-long group project. You will use it to pursue a
            topic of your interest in Machine Learning. At the end of
            the term, you will be required to produce a NIPS-style
            conference paper, and to give a short presentation. Along
            the way, your group will turn in a very short proposal and a
            somewhat longer progress report. The guidelines for the
            group project are provided in the Resources tab.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><b>Midterm.</b> There will be a written, closed-book
            midterm roughly halfway through the term.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><b>Final Exam.</b> There will be a written, closed-book
            final exam at the time that has been scheduled for our
            class' final exam.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4><strong><strong>Numbers</strong></strong></h4>
      <table width="150" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="1" border="0">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td><b>Component</b></td>
            <td>&nbsp;</td>
          </tr>

      </table>
      <br>
      <p align="justify">Although class participation is not explictly
        graded, I will use your class participation to determine whether
        your grade can be lifted in case you are right on the edge of
        two grades. Participation means attending classes, participating
        in class discussions, asking relevant questions, volunteering to
        provide answers to questions, and providing constructive
        criticism and creative suggestions that improve the course.</p>
      <h4><strong><strong>Due Dates</strong></strong></h4>
      <p align="justify">All graded assignments are due by the time and
        date indicated. Late assignments are not accepted and there will
        be no make up exams. You will get zero credit for any late
        assignment. The only exceptions will require: a <b>note</b>
        from an appropriate authority and <b>immediate notification</b>
        of the problem when it arises. You should also treat assigned
        readings as assignments that are due at the beginning of each
        class.</p>
      <h4><strong><strong>Statement of Academic Honesty</strong></strong></h4>
      <p align="justify">You are all expected to follow the university's
        code of academic conduct (<a
          href="http://www.honor.gatech.edu/content/2/the-honor-code">Honor
          Code</a>).</p>
      <p align="justify">Failure to cite your sources is an Honor Code
        violation. Unauthorized use of any previous semester course
        materials, such as tests, quizzes, homework, projects, and any
        other coursework, is prohibited in this course. Using these
        materials will be considered a direct violation of academic
        policy and will be dealt with according to the GT Academic Honor
        Code.</p>
      <p align="justify">Learning about algorithms from text or online
        sources is permissible. Copying content verbatim from online or
        another student is not permissible.</p>
      <p align="justify">Furthermore, copies of the exams are not
        allowed to be out in the ether (so there should not be any out
        there for you to use anyway). If you violate the policy in any
        shape, form or fashion you will be dealt with according to the
        GT Academic Honor Code.</p>
      <p align="justify">Be honest in solving your assignments and exams
        and you will learn and enjoy the material.</p>
      <h4><strong><strong>Disclaimer</strong></strong></h4>
      <p align="justify">The syllabus and course page should be
        considered a living document subject to change throughout the
        course of the semester. I reserve the right to modify any of
        these plans as need be during the course of the class; however,
        I won't do anything too drastic, and you'll be informed as far
        in advance as possible.</p>
