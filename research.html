      My thesis is titled "<b>HELP - Human assisted Efficient Learning
        Protocols</b>". My advisor is Prof. Michael Littman (Rutgers CS
      department) and Prof. Zoran Gajic (Rutgers ECE Department).<br>
      <br>
      Abstract -<br>
      <br>
      In recent years, there has been a growing attention towards the
      development of artificial agents that can naturally communicate
      and interact with humans. The focus has primarily been on creating
      systems that have the ability to unify advanced learning
      algorithms along with various natural forms of human interaction
      (like providing advice, guidance, motivation, punishment, etc).
      However, despite the progress made, interactive systems are still
      directed towards researchers and scientists and consequently the
      everyday human is unable to exploit the potential of these
      systems. Another undesirable component is that in most cases, the
      interacting human is required to communicate with the artificial
      agent a large number of times, making the human often fatigued. In
      order to improve these systems, this thesis extends prior work and
      introduces novel approaches via Human-assisted Efficient Learning
      Protocols (HELP). Three case studies are presented that detail
      distinct aspects of HELP - a) representation of the task to be
      learned and its associated constraints, b) the efficiency of the
      learning algorithm used by the artificial agent and c) the
      unexplored "natural" modes of human interaction. The case studies
      will show how an artificial agent is able to efficiently learn
      and perform complex tasks using only a limited number of
      interactions with a human. Each of these studies involves humans
      subjects interacting with a real robot and/or simulated agent to
      learn a particular task. The focus of HELP is to show that a
      machine can learn better from humans if it is given the ability to
      take advantage of the knowledge provided by interacting with a
      human partner or teacher.<br>
